Hello! I’m an Applied Researcher at Capital One, specializing in machine learning and foundation models. Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Scientist at JPMorganChase, where I applied machine learning and natural language processing techniques to solve challenges in cybersecurity and technology infrastructure. I hold a PhD in Nuclear Engineering and an MS in Computational Science and Engineering from Georgia Tech, where I applied interdisciplinary approaches to machine learning for plasma physics. My research focuses on developing and applying machine learning models across a range of domains, including cybersecurity, economics, and physics.
