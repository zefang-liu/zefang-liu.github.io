**Abstract**

Controlled thermonuclear fusion in tokamaks brings forth demands for burning plasma space-time dynamics computations. The deuterium-tritium fusion generates energetic alpha particles in the plasma core, which will collisionally transfer their energies first to core electrons and slightly later to core ions. The heated core electrons will produce electron cyclotron radiation, thereby transferring energy to the edge plasma and wall. The heated core electrons will also collisionally heat core ions on a slightly longer timescale, which can increase the core fusion reaction rate and possibly lead to a thermal runaway instability. Once energy is radiated or transported from the core to the edge, it will be radiated by seeded impurities in the edge plasma. The various timescales of radiation and transport in and among the different regions will determine the dynamics of the plasma. We are developing a multi-region multi-timescale transport model to simulate burning plasma dynamics in tokamaks. The core, edge, scrape-off layer (SOL), and divertor will be modeled as nodes, within and among which internodal transport and radiation will be calculated. The internodal transport times will be computed both theoretically and by comparison with DIII-D experiments. This model subsequently will be extrapolated to simulate ITER fusion plasmas and used to study the possibility of a fusion thermal runaway instability.
