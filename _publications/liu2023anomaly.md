**Abstract**

Anomaly detection in command shell sessions is a critical aspect of computer security. Recent advances in deep learning and natural language processing, particularly transformer-based models, have shown great promise for addressing complex security challenges. In this paper, we implement a comprehensive approach to detect anomalies in Unix shell sessions using a pretrained DistilBERT model, leveraging both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to identify anomalous activity while minimizing data labeling. The unsupervised method captures the underlying structure and syntax of Unix shell commands, enabling the detection of session deviations from normal behavior. Experiments on a large-scale enterprise dataset collected from production systems demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalous behavior in Unix shell sessions. This work highlights the potential of leveraging recent advances in transformers to address important computer security challenges.
